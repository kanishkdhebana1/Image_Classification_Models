# Plant-leaf Disease Classification
This project implements a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using a deep learning approach. The system utilizes a Multi-Input Attention-based LSTM model to analyze network traffic data from the UNSW-NB15 dataset and classify it as either benign or malicious.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to compare the performance of 3 types of Machine-Learnig Models: 
- Classical Machine Learning Model, like Random-Forest, applied on GLCM-extracted features.
- A custom implementation of CNN model on raw images.
- Transfer Learning on pretrained Resnet model (by freezing hidden layers).

# Dataset
The PlantVillage Dataset dataset is used in this project. It can be obtained from [www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrwellsdavid/unsw-nb15](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)]. The dataset contains 20,000 image samples of plant leaves.
